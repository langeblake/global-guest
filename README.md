- **Calendar Components with react-date-range**:
  - Challenge: Integrating calendar components for booking dates can be challenging, especially to ensure a user-friendly interface and handling date range selections.
  - Solution: Utilized the react-date-range library to implement intuitive and responsive date range pickers. Configured the components to manage date selection and validate booking availability based on stored data.

- **Setting up MongoDB with Prisma to Store Listings and Booked Trips**:
  - Challenge: Setting up MongoDB with Prisma to store listings and booked trips requires configuring database schemas, managing data relationships, and implementing CRUD operations.
  - Solution: Leveraged Prisma's ORM capabilities to define database models and relationships. Utilized MongoDB as the data store for listings and booked trips, enabling efficient data storage and retrieval. Implemented Prisma Client to interact with the database, enabling seamless integration with the Next.js application.
